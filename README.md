# ProtonMail Web Client


Official AngularJS web client for the [ProtonMail secure email service](https://protonmail.com). ProtonMail also makes use of [OpenPGPjs](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs) as our message crytography is PGP compliant.

## Basic Installation

> :warning: You must have node.js >= v6 _and_ npm 5. Node 8 is recommended.

- `$ npm install`
- `$ npm start`

#### If you have docker, and prefer to not install node (or anything else) locally

- `make start` to start the app on a container (use `make localurl` to find the url where it's running)
- `make test` to build the app (actual tests are still to come)

There is a very good chance you won't be able to use the app locally because of various security headers and such. But you should be able to get the code running enough to poke around and inspect it.

We are still in Beta and will have a more refined build process, installation instructions, unit tests, and all that good stuff once we exit Beta.

## Development

We are very open to bug reports via Issues as well as Pull Requests.

### CLI Flags
